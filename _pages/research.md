[Political regime and COVID 19 death rate: Efficient, biasing or simply different autocracies? An econometric analysis.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100912) (with [Guilhem Cassan](https://perso.unamur.be/~gcassan/))

<summary><em>Abstract</em></summary> 
'The difference in COVID 19 death rates across political regimes has caught a lot of attention. The “efficient autocracy” view suggests that autocracies may be more efficient at putting in place policies that contain COVID 19 spread. On the other hand, the “biasing autocracy” view underlines that autocracies may be under reporting their COVID 19 data. We use fixed effect panel regression methods to discriminate between the two sides of the debate. Our results present a more nuanced picture: once pre-determined characteristics of countries are accounted for, COVID 19 death rates equalize across political regimes during the first months of the pandemic, but remain largely different a year into the pandemic. This emphasizes that early differences across political regimes were mainly due to omitted variable bias, whereas later differences are likely due to data manipulation by autocracies. A year into the pandemic, we estimate that this data manipulation may have hidden approximately 400,000 deaths worldwide.'

## Working Papers

**Gender-biased fertility preferences may decrease fertility: evidence from a counterfactual analysis** (with [Guilhem Cassan](https://perso.unamur.be/~gcassan/))

<details>
<summary><em>Abstract</em></summary> 
'Gender-biased fertility preferences are prevalent in many societies. They are commonly thought to be a driver of excess fertility. We show here that this is not necessarily true: switching from gender-biased to gender-neutral fertility preferences can increase excess fertility.  The magnitude and the sign of the variation in excess fertility depends on the choice of gender-neutral fertility counterfactual. We illustrate our findings using data from the Indian Demographic and Health Surveys and show that gender-biased fertility preferences can lead to a change in excess fertility ranging from -15% to 23% of the total excess fertility or -4% to 6% of total fertility.'

**Support for refugees declines when helping groups are asymmetric** (with [Hannes Rusch](https://hrusch.de/), [Robert Böhm](https://robertboehm.info/), and [Paul A.M. van Lange](https://www.paulvanlange.com/))

<summary><em>Abstract</em></summary> 
'Supporting refugees along their migration journeys involves multiple groups of citizens, which often differ in their ability to provide help. To study how such heterogeneity causally affects citizens’ willingness to help refugees, we utilize a framed economic game in which two groups of four citizen players (n = 910) decide about helping a passive refugee player (n = 114). One group of citizens (early-positioned) makes their decisions before the other group of citizens (late-positioned). We implement unequal abilities to help by systematically varying the endowment of the two groups (low vs. high).
Our results suggest that unequal endowments between groups lead early-positioned groups to help less, irrespective of those groups’ own endowments. Similarly, late-positioned groups with low endowment help less. Our study contributes to the literature on the determinants of collective support for refugees and provides new insights on altruistic behavior in asymmetrical groups.'
