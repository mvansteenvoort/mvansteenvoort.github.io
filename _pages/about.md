Hello and welcome to my webpage! 
<br/>


I joined the [University of Namur](https://www.unamur.be/en) in September 2024, where I will be working as a post-doctoral researcher on the project "IDnomics: Identities, norms, and economic behavior".  
<br/>

My research interests lie in the areas of migration, gender, and political economy.
