[Political regime and COVID 19 death rate: Efficient, biasing or simply different autocracies? An econometric analysis.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100912) (with [Guilhem Cassan](https://perso.unamur.be/~gcassan/))

*Abstract*: 'The difference in COVID 19 death rates across political regimes has caught a lot of attention. The “efficient autocracy” view suggests that autocracies may be more efficient at putting in place policies that contain COVID 19 spread. On the other hand, the “biasing autocracy” view underlines that autocracies may be under reporting their COVID 19 data. We use fixed effect panel regression methods to discriminate between the two sides of the debate. Our results present a more nuanced picture: once pre-determined characteristics of countries are accounted for, COVID 19 death rates equalize across political regimes during the first months of the pandemic, but remain largely different a year into the pandemic. This emphasizes that early differences across political regimes were mainly due to omitted variable bias, whereas later differences are likely due to data manipulation by autocracies. A year into the pandemic, we estimate that this data manipulation may have hidden approximately 400,000 deaths worldwide.'

## Working Papers

**Gender-biased fertility preferences may decrease fertility: evidence from a counterfactual analysis** (with [Guilhem Cassan](https://perso.unamur.be/~gcassan/))

*Abstract*: 'Gender-biased fertility preferences are prevalent in many societies. They are commonly thought to be a driver of excess fertility. We show here that this is not necessarily true: switching from gender-biased to gender-neutral fertility preferences can increase excess fertility.  The magnitude and the sign of the variation in excess fertility depends on the choice of gender-neutral fertility counterfactual. We illustrate our findings using data from the Indian Demographic and Health Surveys and show that gender-biased fertility preferences can lead to a change in excess fertility ranging from -15% to 23% of the total excess fertility or -4% to 6% of total fertility.' 

**Support for refugees declines when helping groups are asymmetric** (with [Hannes Rusch](https://hrusch.de/), [Robert Böhm](https://robertboehm.info/), and [Paul A.M. van Lange](https://www.paulvanlange.com/))

*Abstract*: 'The costs of helping refugees are often shared across multiple countries, and these countries can differ in several dimensions. To study how such asymmetries causally affect citizens' willingness to help refugees, we utilize a framed economic game in which two groups of four citizen players (n=910) decide about helping a passive refugee player (n=114).  We systematically vary the endowment of the two groups (low vs. high) and the timing of their decisions (sequential vs. simultaneous). We find that between-group endowment asymmetries lead groups in early position to help less, irrespective of those groups' own endowments. Similarly, groups in late position with a low endowment help less when the two groups have asymmetrical endowments. Our study contributes to the literature on the determinants of collective support for refugees and provides new insights on altruistic behaviour in asymmetrical groups.'
